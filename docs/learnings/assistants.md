# Assistant Configuration Gotchas

Non-obvious behaviors and silent defaults for Vapi assistant settings.

---

## Model Defaults

### `temperature` defaults to 0, `maxTokens` defaults to 250

If omitted, Vapi defaults to `temperature: 0` and `maxTokens: 250`. This can cause unexpectedly short responses.

**Recommendation:** Set `maxTokens` explicitly (e.g., 1000–4000) for assistants that need longer responses.

### `numFastTurns` switches the model, not just latency

**What you might expect:** A latency optimization hint.

**What actually happens:** For OpenAI, `numFastTurns: N` switches the model to `gpt-3.5-turbo` for the first N conversational turns, then reverts to your configured model.

**Recommendation:** Only use this if you're comfortable with 3.5-turbo quality for early turns.

### `emotionRecognitionEnabled` has no runtime effect

Despite being a configurable field, this setting currently has **no effect** on call behavior. Don't rely on it.

---

## Voice Configuration

### `chunkPlan.enabled: false` can reduce latency

Disabling the chunk plan skips text formatting/preprocessing before TTS. This gives you raw LLM text (potentially with markdown or formatting artifacts) but lower latency.

### `inputPunctuationBoundaries` has multiple override layers

Priority order: top-level `inputPunctuationBoundaries` > `chunkPlan.punctuationBoundaries` > provider defaults. This means a top-level setting always wins over `chunkPlan`.

### Squad voice overrides **union-merge** punctuation boundaries

When merging voice overrides in squads, `inputPunctuationBoundaries` arrays are **unioned** (combined), not replaced. This can lead to more chunk boundaries than expected.

---

## Transcriber Configuration

### Provider recommendations by language

| Language | Recommended Provider |
|----------|---------------------|
| English | Deepgram Nova-3 |
| Spanish | Deepgram Nova-3 |
| Portuguese | Azure Transcriber |

For multilingual setups, see [multilingual.md](multilingual.md).

### `confidenceThreshold` defaults to 0.4

If omitted, transcripts with confidence below 0.4 may be **ignored** entirely (not just flagged). This includes final transcripts, not just partials.

### Use Smart Denoising (Krisp) for background noise

[Smart Denoising (Krisp)](https://docs.vapi.ai/documentation/assistants/conversation-behavior/background-speech-denoising#smart-denoising-krisp) is recommended over [Fourier Denoising](https://docs.vapi.ai/documentation/assistants/conversation-behavior/background-speech-denoising#fourier-denoising-experimental) (experimental). Enable it via `backgroundDenoisingEnabled: true` or `smartDenoisingPlan.enabled: true`.

Boost domain-specific vocabulary with [Custom Keywords](https://docs.vapi.ai/customization/custom-keywords) to improve recognition of brand names, product names, and industry terms.

### `smartEndpointingPlan` **owns** turn detection when set

If you configure `startSpeakingPlan.smartEndpointingPlan`, the transcriber's own `endpointing` settings (voice activity detection timeouts, etc.) are **not used** for turn detection. Smart endpointing takes full control.

**Recommendation:** Don't set both and expect them to combine. Choose one approach.

---

## firstMessage Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `assistant-speaks-first` (default) | Uses the `firstMessage` text. TTS audio is pre-loaded for instant playback. |
| `assistant-speaks-first-with-model-generated-message` | Ignores `firstMessage`. The LLM generates the first message from `model.messages`. |
| `assistant-waits-for-user` | Bot stays silent until the user speaks. TTS for `firstMessage` is still pre-loaded in case it's needed later. |

**Gotcha:** `assistant-speaks-first-with-model-generated-message` is not supported by all realtime providers (e.g., Google Gemini Realtime will error).

---

## Hooks

### Invalid hooks are silently skipped

Hooks that fail validation are dropped without error. Your call will proceed without them.

### Missing hook `toolId` is a warning, not an error

If a hook references a `toolId` that doesn't exist, Vapi logs a warning and continues. This is different from `model.toolIds` where a missing ID **errors the call**.

### Hook events are independent from timeout settings

`customer.speech.timeout` (hook) and `silenceTimeoutSeconds` (assistant) are separate mechanisms. The hook fires an action; the timeout ends the call. Configure them independently.

### Available hook events

- `call.ending` — call is about to end
- `assistant.speech.interrupted` — assistant was interrupted
- `customer.speech.interrupted` — customer was interrupted
- `customer.speech.timeout` — customer hasn't spoken for N seconds
- `model.response.timeout` — model hasn't responded
- `assistant.transcriber.endpointedSpeechLowConfidence` — low-confidence transcript
- `call.timeElapsed` — N seconds since call start

---

## Idle Messages (messagePlan)

### Defaults

| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| `idleTimeoutSeconds` | 10 |
| `idleMessageMaxSpokenCount` | 3 |
| `idleMessageResetCountOnUserSpeechEnabled` | **false** |
| `idleMessages` | empty (no idle messages) |

### `idleMessageResetCountOnUserSpeechEnabled` resets the **count**, not the timer

When true, user speech resets `idleMessageSpokenCount` back to 0 — so the assistant can cycle through idle messages again after the user re-engages.

### Idle messages are skipped during transfers and active tool calls

If a warm transfer is in progress or a tool call is executing, idle messages won't fire.

---

## Endpointing (startSpeakingPlan)

### `waitSeconds` defaults to 0.4s

If not set, there's a 0.4-second pause after the user stops speaking before the assistant responds.

### `waitSeconds` and `smartEndpointingPlan` control different things

- `waitSeconds` controls a short pause on assistant audio after voice activity is detected — it delays the assistant's response by that duration.
- `smartEndpointingPlan` controls how end-of-turn is detected — it determines when the user has finished speaking using an AI model or heuristic.

These are complementary, not alternatives.

---

## Interruption (stopSpeakingPlan)

### Defaults

| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| `numWords` | 2 |
| `voiceSeconds` | 0.2 |
| `backoffSeconds` | 1.0 |

`numWords: 2` means the user must speak 2 words before the assistant stops talking. Lower values make the assistant more interruptible.

---

## Analysis & Artifacts

### Summary is enabled by default

Unless you explicitly set `analysisPlan.summaryPlan.enabled: false`, post-call summaries are generated automatically.

### Recording is enabled by default

Unless you set `artifactPlan.recordingEnabled: false`, calls are recorded. Vapi also checks `assistant.recordingEnabled` (deprecated) before defaulting to `true`.

### Default transcript labels are "AI" and "User"

Not the assistant's name. Override with `artifactPlan.transcriptPlan.assistantName` / `userName`.

---

## Background Sound & Denoising

### Phone calls default to `office` background sound, web calls to `off`

If `backgroundSound` is omitted, the default depends on the transport type.

### `backgroundDenoisingEnabled` is deprecated but still works

It maps to `smartDenoisingPlan.enabled`. The plan defaults to `true` if nothing says otherwise.

---

## Server Messages

### Default webhook events (sent when `serverMessages` is not set)

```yaml
- conversation-update
- end-of-call-report
- function-call
- hang
- speech-update
- status-update
- tool-calls
- transfer-destination-request
- handoff-destination-request
- user-interrupted
- assistant.started
```

Omitting `serverMessages` does **not** mean "no webhooks." It means "all defaults."

**Recommendation:** Set `serverMessages` explicitly if you want to reduce webhook noise.

---

## HIPAA / Compliance

When HIPAA is enabled (on org or assistant) and HIPAA provider validation is enforced for your org, the model, voice, and transcriber providers must be on Vapi's approved allowlist. Non-compliant providers will **fail validation** on create/update.

---

## Tool Resolution (toolIds vs inline)

### Resolution order

1. Inline `model.tools` are processed first
2. Each `toolId` is resolved from the org's saved tools — **a missing ID errors the call**
3. Results are merged: `[...inline tools, ...resolved toolIds]`
4. MCP tools are expanded from configured integrations

### `toolIds` and inline `tools` can coexist

They are merged, not mutually exclusive. But be aware of potential duplicates.
