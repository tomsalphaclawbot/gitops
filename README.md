# Vapi GitOps

Manage Vapi resources via Git using YAML/Markdown as the source-of-truth.

## Why GitOps?

|                       | Dashboard / Ad-hoc API                                          | GitOps                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **History**           | Limited visibility of who changed what                          | Full git history with blame                |
| **Review**            | Changes go live immediately (can break things)                  | PR review before deploy                    |
| **Rollback**          | Manual recreation                                               | `git revert` + push                        |
| **Environments**      | Tedious to copy-paste between envs                              | Same config, different state files         |
| **Collaboration**     | One person at a time. Need to duplicate assistants, tools, etc. | Team can collaborate and use git branching |
| **Reproducibility**   | "It worked on my assistant!"                                    | Declarative, version-controlled            |
| **Disaster Recovery** | Hope you have backups                                           | Re-apply from git                          |

### Key Benefits

- **Audit Trail** — Every change is a commit with author, timestamp, and reason
- **Code Review** — Catch misconfigurations before they hit production
- **Environment Parity** — Dev, staging, and prod stay in sync
- **No Drift** — Pull merges platform changes; push makes git the truth
- **Automation Ready** — Plug into CI/CD pipelines

### Supported Resources

| Resource               | Status | Format                               |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Assistants**         | ✅     | `.md` (with system prompt) or `.yml` |
| **Tools**              | ✅     | `.yml`                               |
| **Structured Outputs** | ✅     | `.yml`                               |
| **Squads**             | ✅     | `.yml`                               |
| **Personalities**      | ✅     | `.yml`                               |
| **Scenarios**          | ✅     | `.yml`                               |
| **Simulations**        | ✅     | `.yml`                               |
| **Simulation Suites**  | ✅     | `.yml`                               |

## How to Use This Repo

1. **Bootstrap state first** using `pull:*:bootstrap` when you need fresh platform mappings without downloading the org's resources into your working tree.
2. **Edit declarative resources** in `resources/<env>/` (`.md` assistants, `.yml` tools/squads/etc.).
3. **Push selectively while iterating** (resource type or file path), then run a full push before release.
4. **Promote by environment** (`dev` -> `stg` -> `prod`) by copying files between `resources/dev/`, `resources/stg/`, and `resources/prod/`.

Use:

- `pull` when Vapi might have changed
- `push` for explicit deploys
- `apply` (`pull -> merge -> push`) when you want one command for sync + deploy

For template-based repos, `push` now auto-runs a bootstrap state sync when local state is missing credential mappings or contains stale IDs for the resources you're applying.

### Basic Workflow

```bash
# First time in a template clone: refresh only state and credentials
npm run pull:dev:bootstrap

# Add or edit only the resources you actually want under resources/dev/

# Push your changes (full sync)
npm run push:dev
```

#### Bootstrap State Sync (Template-Safe First Run)

Use bootstrap pull when you need the latest platform IDs and credential mappings but do not want the repo filled with assistants, tools, and other resources from the target Vapi org:

```bash
npm run pull:dev:bootstrap
```

This mode:

- Pulls credentials into `.vapi-state.<env>.json`
- Refreshes remote resource ID mappings in the state file
- Leaves `resources/<env>/` untouched so your working tree stays focused on the resources you actually intend to manage

If you skip this step, `push` will automatically run the same bootstrap sync when it detects empty or stale state for the resources being applied.

Promotion example:

```bash
# After validating in dev, copy to staging and push
cp resources/dev/squads/your-squad.yml resources/stg/squads/
npm run push:stg

# Promote to prod when ready
cp resources/stg/squads/your-squad.yml resources/prod/squads/
npm run push:prod
```

#### Pulling Without Losing Local Work

By default, `pull` preserves any files you've locally modified or deleted:

```bash
# Edit an assistant locally...

npm run pull:dev
# ⏭️  my-assistant (locally changed, skipping)
# ✨  new-tool -> resources/dev/tools/new-tool.yml
# Your edits are preserved, new platform resources are downloaded
```

#### Force Pull (Platform as Source of Truth)

When you want the platform version of everything, overwriting all local files:

```bash
npm run pull:dev:force
# ⚡ Force mode: overwriting all local files with platform state
```

#### Reviewing Platform Changes

```bash
# Pull platform state (your local changes are preserved)
npm run pull:dev

# See what changed on the platform vs your last commit
git diff

# Accept platform changes for a specific file
git checkout -- resources/dev/tools/some-tool.yml
```

### Selective Push (Partial Sync)

Push only specific resources instead of syncing everything:

#### By Resource Type

```bash
npm run push:dev assistants
npm run push:dev tools
npm run push:dev squads
npm run push:dev structuredOutputs
npm run push:dev personalities
npm run push:dev scenarios
npm run push:dev simulations
npm run push:dev simulationSuites
```

#### By Specific File(s)

```bash
# Push a single file
npm run push:dev resources/dev/assistants/my-assistant.md

# Push multiple files
npm run push:dev resources/dev/assistants/booking.md resources/dev/tools/my-tool.yml
```

#### Combined

```bash
# Push specific file within a type
npm run push:dev assistants resources/dev/assistants/booking.md
```

**Note:** Partial pushes skip deletion checks. Run full `npm run push:dev` to sync deletions.

#### Auto-Dependency Resolution

Partial push is ideal for promoting specific squads or assistants to staging/prod without pushing everything. The engine automatically detects and creates missing dependencies:

```bash
# Push a single squad to staging — tools, structured outputs, and
# assistants are created automatically if they don't exist yet
npm run push:stg resources/stg/squads/everblue-voice-squad-20374c37.yml

# Push assistants to prod — missing tools and structured outputs
# are auto-applied first so references resolve correctly
npm run push:prod assistants
```

The dependency chain resolves recursively:

```
Squad push
  └─ missing assistants? → auto-create them first
       └─ missing tools / structured outputs? → auto-create those first
            └─ then create the assistant
  └─ all references resolved → create the squad ✓

Assistant push
  └─ missing tools / structured outputs? → auto-create them first
  └─ all references resolved → create the assistant ✓
```

If a dependency already exists on the platform (UUID in the state file) but its nested dependencies don't, those are still auto-created and the parent resource is updated to reference them.

This means you can work on everything in dev, then selectively push a single squad or assistant to staging or prod — no need for a full `push` that touches every resource.

### Webhook Local Testing

Use the local mock receiver when validating Vapi `serverMessages` delivery.

```bash
# 1) Run local receiver
npm run mock:webhook

# 2) Expose localhost (example)
ngrok http 8787
```

Then set your assistant `server.url` to the ngrok HTTPS URL and include event types like:

- `speech-update`
- `status-update`
- `end-of-call-report`

The mock server exposes:

- `POST /webhook` (or `POST /`)
- `GET /health`
- `GET /events`

## File Formats

### Assistants with System Prompts (`.md`)

Assistants with system prompts use **Markdown with YAML frontmatter**. The system prompt is written as readable Markdown below the config:

```markdown
---
name: My Assistant
voice:
  provider: 11labs
  voiceId: abc123
model:
  model: gpt-4o
  provider: openai
  toolIds:
    - my-tool
firstMessage: Hello! How can I help you?
---

# Identity & Purpose

You are a helpful assistant for the business you represent.

# Conversation Flow

1. Greet the user
2. Ask how you can help
3. Resolve their issue

# Rules

- Always be polite
- Never make up information
```

**Benefits:**

- System prompts are readable Markdown (not escaped YAML strings)
- Proper syntax highlighting in editors
- Easy to write headers, lists, tables
- Configuration stays cleanly separated at the top

### Assistants without System Prompts (`.yml`)

Simple assistants without custom system prompts use plain YAML:

```yaml
name: Simple Assistant
voice:
  provider: vapi
  voiceId: Elliot
model:
  model: gpt-4o-mini
  provider: openai
firstMessage: Hello!
```

### Tools (`.yml`)

```yaml
type: function
function:
  name: get_weather
  description: Get the current weather for a location
  parameters:
    type: object
    properties:
      location:
        type: string
        description: The city name
    required:
      - location
server:
  url: https://my-api.com/weather
```

### Structured Outputs (`.yml`)

```yaml
name: Call Summary
type: ai
description: Summarizes the key points of a call
schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    summary:
      type: string
    sentiment:
      type: string
      enum: [positive, neutral, negative]
assistant_ids:
  - my-assistant
```

### Squads (`.yml`)

```yaml
name: Support Squad
members:
  - assistantId: intake-agent
    assistantDestinations:
      - type: assistant
        assistantId: specialist-agent
        message: Transferring you to a specialist.
  - assistantId: specialist-agent
```

### Simulations

**Personality** (`simulations/personalities/`):

```yaml
name: Skeptical Sam
description: A doubtful caller who questions everything
prompt: You are skeptical and need convincing before trusting information.
```

**Scenario** (`simulations/scenarios/`):

```yaml
name: Happy Path - New Customer
description: New customer calling to schedule an appointment
prompt: |
  You are a new customer calling to schedule your first appointment.
  Be cooperative and provide all requested information.
```

**Simulation** (`simulations/tests/`):

```yaml
name: Booking Test Case 1
personalityId: skeptical-sam
scenarioId: happy-path-new-customer
```

**Simulation Suite** (`simulations/suites/`):

```yaml
name: Booking Flow Tests
simulationIds:
  - booking-test-case-1
  - booking-test-case-2
  - booking-test-case-3
```

## How-To Guides

### How to Add a New Assistant

**Option 1: With System Prompt (recommended)**

Create `resources/dev/assistants/my-assistant.md`:

```markdown
---
name: My Assistant
voice:
  provider: 11labs
  voiceId: abc123
model:
  model: gpt-4o
  provider: openai
  toolIds:
    - my-tool
---

# Your System Prompt Here

Instructions for the assistant...
```

**Option 2: Without System Prompt**

Create `resources/dev/assistants/my-assistant.yml`:

```yaml
name: My Assistant
voice:
  provider: vapi
  voiceId: Elliot
model:
  model: gpt-4o-mini
  provider: openai
```

Then push:

```bash
npm run push:dev
```

### How to Add a Tool

Create `resources/dev/tools/my-tool.yml`:

```yaml
type: function
function:
  name: do_something
  description: Does something useful
  parameters:
    type: object
    properties:
      input:
        type: string
    required:
      - input
server:
  url: https://my-api.com/endpoint
```

### How to Reference Resources

Use the **filename without extension** as the resource ID:

```yaml
# In an assistant
model:
  toolIds:
    - my-tool # → resources/<env>/tools/my-tool.yml
    - utils/helper-tool # → resources/<env>/tools/utils/helper-tool.yml
artifactPlan:
  structuredOutputIds:
    - call-summary # → resources/<env>/structuredOutputs/call-summary.yml
```

```yaml
# In a squad
members:
  - assistantId: intake-agent # → resources/<env>/assistants/intake-agent.md
```

```yaml
# In a simulation
personalityId: skeptical-sam # → resources/<env>/simulations/personalities/skeptical-sam.yml
scenarioId: happy-path # → resources/<env>/simulations/scenarios/happy-path.yml
```

### How to Delete a Resource

1. **Remove references** to the resource from other files
2. **Delete the file**: `rm resources/dev/tools/my-tool.yml`
3. **Push**: `npm run push:dev`

The engine will:

- Detect the resource is in state but not in filesystem
- Check for orphan references (will error if still referenced)
- Delete from Vapi
- Remove from state file

### How to Organize Resources into Folders

Create subdirectories only when they help organize related resources by feature or workflow:

```
resources/<env>/
├── assistants/
│   ├── shared/
│   │   └── fallback.md
│   └── support/
│       └── intake.md
├── tools/
│   ├── shared/
│   │   └── transfer-call.yml
│   └── support/
│       └── lookup-customer.yml
```

Reference using full paths:

```yaml
model:
  toolIds:
    - shared/transfer-call
    - support/lookup-customer
```

---

## How the Engine Works

### Sync Workflow

Your local files are the source of truth. The engine respects that:

```
pull (default)     pull --force        push
─────────────      ─────────────       ─────────────
Download from      Download from       Upload local
platform, skip     platform, overwrite files to
locally changed    everything          platform
files
```

**`pull`** downloads platform state. In default mode (git repo required), it detects locally modified or deleted files and skips them — your local work is preserved. New platform resources are still downloaded. Use `--force` to overwrite everything.

**`push`** is the engine — reads local files and syncs them to the platform. Deleted files are removed from the platform.

**`apply`** is the convenience wrapper — runs `pull` then `push` in sequence.

> **Note:** The "skip locally changed files" feature requires a git repo with at least one commit. Without git, pull always overwrites (same as `--force`).

### Processing Order

**Pull** (dependency order):

1. Tools
2. Structured Outputs
3. Assistants
4. Squads
5. Personalities
6. Scenarios
7. Simulations
8. Simulation Suites

**Push** (dependency order):

1. Tools → 2. Structured Outputs → 3. Assistants → 4. Squads
2. Personalities → 6. Scenarios → 7. Simulations → 8. Simulation Suites

**Delete** (reverse dependency order):

1. Simulation Suites → 2. Simulations → 3. Scenarios → 4. Personalities
2. Squads → 6. Assistants → 7. Structured Outputs → 8. Tools

### Reference Resolution

The engine automatically resolves resource IDs to Vapi UUIDs:

```yaml
# You write:
toolIds:
  - my-tool

# Engine sends to API:
toolIds:
  - "uuid-1234-5678-abcd"
```

### Credential Management

Credentials (API keys, JWT secrets, etc.) are environment-specific and managed automatically through the state file. No secrets are stored in resource files or git.

**How it works:**

1. **Pull** fetches all credentials from `GET /credential` and stores `name-slug → UUID` in the state file
2. **Pull** replaces credential UUIDs with human-readable names in resource files
3. **Push** reverses the mapping — resolves credential names back to UUIDs before sending to the API

```yaml
# Resource file stores credential NAME (environment-agnostic)
server:
  url: https://my-api.com/endpoint
  credentialId: my-server-credential # ← human-readable name
```

```json
// State file stores credential UUID (environment-specific)
{
  "credentials": {
    "my-server-credential": "2f6db611-ad08-4099-8bd8-74db37b0a07e"
  }
}
```

**Cross-environment workflow:**

Each environment has its own state file with its own credential UUIDs. The same resource file works across all environments — only the state file differs:

```
.vapi-state.dev.json  → "my-cred": "uuid-for-dev"
.vapi-state.stg.json  → "my-cred": "uuid-for-stg"
.vapi-state.prod.json → "my-cred": "uuid-for-prod"
```

> **Note:** Credentials are auto-discovered from the Vapi API by name. Create credentials with the same name in each environment's Vapi org, and pull will populate the mappings automatically.

### State File

Tracks mapping between resource IDs and Vapi UUIDs:

```json
{
  "credentials": {
    "my-server-credential": "uuid-0000"
  },
  "tools": {
    "my-tool": "uuid-1234"
  },
  "assistants": {
    "my-assistant": "uuid-5678"
  },
  "squads": {
    "my-squad": "uuid-abcd"

## Troubleshooting

### "Reference not found" warnings

The referenced resource doesn't exist. Check:

1. File exists in correct folder
2. Filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Using filename without extension
4. For nested resources, use full path (`folder/resource`)

### "Cannot delete resource - still referenced"

1. Find which resources reference it (shown in error)
2. Remove the references
3. Push again
4. Then delete the resource file

### Resource not updating

Check the state file has correct UUID:

1. Open `.vapi-state.{env}.json`
2. Find the resource entry
3. If incorrect, delete entry and re-run push

### "Credential with ID not found" errors

The credential UUID doesn't exist in the target environment. Fix:

1. Run `npm run pull:{env}` to fetch credentials into the state file
2. If the credential doesn't exist in the target org, create it in the Vapi dashboard with the same name
3. Pull again — the mapping will be auto-populated

### "Unresolved credential" warnings

A resource file has a `credentialId` that couldn't be resolved to a UUID. This means the credential name isn't in the state file. Run `pull` to populate credential mappings.

### "property X should not exist" API errors

Some properties can't be updated after creation. Add them to `UPDATE_EXCLUDED_KEYS` in `src/config.ts`.
